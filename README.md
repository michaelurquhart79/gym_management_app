# gym_management_project
Ruby project using Sinatra to allow basic management of gym members and gym classes

The brief for the MVP of the project was:

  The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete members
  The app should allow the gym to create / edit / delete classes
  The app should allow the gym to add members to specific classes
  The app should show a list of all upcoming classes
  The app should show all members that are registered for a particular class

MVP was met and a number of extensions were added, e.g. to include a membership type for each member and limit the gym classes that the member is allowed to book on based on their membership type.

To run that app:
  clone the repo
  in terminal ensure you are in the folder with the app.rb file
  in terminal type ruby.app rb
  open browser and navigate to localhost:4567

The app is functional but hopefully I will get time in the future to return to the project to tidy up and refactor the code.
In particular, there is quite a lot of redundant commented out code that can be removed.
Also, I would like to add more CSS to the project as the CSS is currently minimal.
